# PS1 Design

## Goals:
- Provide some additional version control beyond the [PS1 Wiki](https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org) to make it easier to track changes and collaborate.
- Design files for internal PS1 usage (templates for creating signs, etc)
- Design files for kickstarting member projects (templates & test files for laser, etc)

At the moment, I am just doing some digital inventory by searching the Wiki & Google Groups and collecting various design templates, styleguides that can be used for designing internally oriented items (like PS1 signage) as well as test files and starter templates that can be used for jump starting CNC/Laser/3D projects. These would be ideally kept in an open file format (i.e. SVG) rather than proprietary formats (AI) to make it easier to maintain in the long run. 

Examples of what might be in here:
- PS1 Logo in vector format
- PS1 Style Guide (suggested colors, typography, formatting etc)
- Template for making signs
- Various vector files for CNC machines (test files, starter templates, design examples)
- General code examples/snippets for building projects
- Documentation that could benefit from version control (supplemental to wiki docs)
